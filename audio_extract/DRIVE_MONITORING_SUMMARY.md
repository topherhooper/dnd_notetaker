# Google Drive Monitoring Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented self-contained Google Drive monitoring functionality within the audio_extract package. This allows the module to continuously monitor Google Drive folders for new Meet recordings and automatically extract audio from them.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Drive Integration Module (`drive/`)
- **auth.py**: Service account authentication with automatic credential discovery
- **client.py**: Minimal Drive API client focused on Meet recording operations
- **monitor.py**: Monitoring service that checks for new recordings and processes them

### 2. Configuration System (`config.py`)
- YAML/JSON configuration file support
- Environment variable overrides
- Default configuration values
- Validation methods

### 3. CLI Tool (`cli/monitor.py`, `dev_monitor.py`)
- Command-line interface for monitoring operations
- Support for one-time and continuous monitoring
- Connection testing functionality
- Flexible configuration options

### 4. Database Schema Updates
- Added `drive_files` table for tracking discovered files
- Added `sync_history` table for monitoring operations
- Extended tracker.py with Drive-specific methods

### 5. Dependencies
Updated requirements.txt with:
- google-api-python-client>=2.0.0
- google-auth>=2.0.0
- google-auth-httplib2>=0.1.0
- google-auth-oauthlib>=0.4.0
- pyyaml>=6.0

### 6. Documentation
- Updated README.md with Drive monitoring instructions
- Created example configuration file
- Added usage examples for both CLI and programmatic use

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Test connection
python -m audio_extract.dev_monitor --test --folder-id YOUR_FOLDER_ID

# Run once
python -m audio_extract.dev_monitor --once --config config.yaml

# Continuous monitoring
python -m audio_extract.dev_monitor --folder-id YOUR_FOLDER_ID --interval 60
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from audio_extract import Config, DriveAuth, DriveClient, DriveMonitor
from audio_extract import ProcessingTracker, AudioExtractor

# Initialize and run monitoring
config = Config('config.yaml')
monitor = DriveMonitor(tracker, extractor, output_dir)
monitor.monitor(folder_id, days_back=7)
```

## Key Features

1. **Self-contained**: All Drive functionality is within the audio_extract package
2. **Flexible authentication**: Supports service accounts with multiple credential locations
3. **Configurable**: YAML/JSON config files or environment variables
4. **Robust tracking**: SQLite database tracks all processed files and sync history
5. **Error handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and API errors
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new features or integrate with other services

## Next Steps

1. Set up Google Cloud service account and enable Drive API
2. Create configuration file with your Drive folder ID
3. Run `python -m audio_extract.dev_monitor --test` to verify setup
4. Start monitoring with `python -m audio_extract.dev_monitor`

The implementation is complete and tested with mocked Drive API calls. The module is ready for use with real Google Drive credentials.
