# No Try/Except Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Removed ALL try/except blocks from the audio_extract module to implement a "fail fast" philosophy. Errors now bubble up immediately with full stack traces.

## Files Modified

1. **config.py** - Removed error handling from file I/O operations
2. **tracker.py** - Removed 11 try/except blocks from database operations  
3. **extractor.py** - Removed error handling from FFmpeg execution
4. **drive/auth.py** - Removed 3 blocks from credential operations
5. **drive/client.py** - Removed 4 blocks from API calls
6. **drive/monitor.py** - Removed 2 blocks from file processing
7. **cli/monitor.py** - Removed error handling from main function
8. **dashboard/server.py** - Removed 4 blocks from request handlers

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Error Visibility** - No hidden failures
2. **Full Stack Traces** - Easy debugging with complete error context
3. **Fail Fast in Dev** - Aligns with `stop_on_error: true` in dev config
4. **Simpler Code** - Less nesting, clearer logic flow

## Test Results

- **71 tests total**
- **All tests pass** after updating 2 tests to expect exceptions
- Tests now verify that errors propagate correctly

## Usage Impact

### Development Mode
With `stop_on_error: true` in dev config:
- Any error immediately stops execution
- Full traceback shown in console
- Perfect for debugging

### Production Mode  
With `stop_on_error: false` in prod config:
- Errors will still crash the process
- Should use process manager (systemd, supervisor) to restart
- Email notifications on failure still work via process exit

## Example Error Output

```

No more silent failures or generic "An error occurred" messages!
